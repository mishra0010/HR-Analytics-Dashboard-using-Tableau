# HR Analytics Dashboard Using Tableau
Project Description
This project is focused on gaining in-depth insights into employee attrition within a company. By analyzing a comprehensive CSV file containing detailed company data, I have created an interactive and visually engaging dashboard using Tableau. The goal is to provide HR professionals with a powerful tool to understand and address the reasons behind employee turnover. The dashboard leverages data visualization to transform complex data sets into clear and actionable insights, allowing HR teams to make informed decisions to improve employee retention.

Installation
To get started with the HR Analytics Dashboard, follow these detailed steps:

Install Tableau:

Download Tableau from the official website.
Follow the installation instructions to set up Tableau on your computer.
Download CSV File:

Connect CSV File to Tableau:

Open Tableau and select the "Connect to Data" option.
Choose the "Text File" option from the list of data connection options.
Navigate to the location of the CSV file on your system and select it to load the data into Tableau.
Import Dashboard:

This file contains the pre-built charts and dashboard that you can use to analyze the data.
Features
The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive range of features and visualizations designed to help HR professionals effectively analyze and understand employee attrition:

Comprehensive Data Visualization:

The dashboard is designed to simplify the analysis of complex company data through a range of visualizations. This approach helps in identifying trends, patterns, and areas of concern related to employee attrition.
Key Metrics:

Employee Count: Displays the total number of employees within the company.
Attrition Count and Rate: Provides insights into the number of employees who have left the company and the corresponding attrition rate.
Active Employees: Shows the current number of employees who are still with the company.
Average Age: Calculates and displays the average age of employees.
Attrition by Gender: Breaks down the attrition rates based on gender, allowing for gender-specific analysis.
Department-wise Attrition: Analyzes attrition rates across different departments to identify departments with higher turnover rates.
Employees by Age Group: Segments employees into different age groups to analyze attrition patterns within these groups.
Job Satisfaction Ratings: Assesses job satisfaction levels and correlates them with attrition rates.
Education Background-wise Attrition: Examines how attrition rates vary according to employees' educational backgrounds.
Attrition Rate by Gender and Age Group: Provides a detailed analysis of attrition rates by combining gender and age group data.
Variety of Charts:

Pie Chart: Utilized to show proportions of different categories, making it easy to see the relative sizes of different segments.
Donut Chart: Offers a visually appealing way to represent parts of a whole, similar to a pie chart but with a central cutout.
Bar Chart: Effective for comparing different categories side-by-side, helping to identify which categories have the highest or lowest values.
Lollipop Chart: Simplifies comparisons with a straightforward visual representation, combining elements of bar and dot charts.
Heat Maps: Visualizes data density and variations using color gradients, making it easy to identify patterns and anomalies in the data.
Interactive Features:

Education Filter: Allows users to filter the data based on different education levels. This feature dynamically updates all related charts to reflect the selected education level.
Clickable Data Points: Enhances interactivity by allowing users to click on data points in one chart. This action updates all other charts to display related data, providing a detailed and integrated view of the information.
Custom Design:

The dashboard features a custom-designed background to improve visual appeal and user engagement. This design choice helps create a more engaging and professional presentation of the data.
